#### TESTUDO'S CHOICE

a website that provides AI generated feedback of a class and its professors based on the reviews of a professor, the description of a class, and the typical/average grades of the class.







## Inspiration
We were all interested in working with AI frameworks, and we saw a need for a site that quickly compares class reviews. 
## What it does
Users can input the desired course name then the program will display information on the course (average GPA, professors, and course description) and give the user the pros and cons of the class. The user will be shown the professors of the course and give a final analysis recommending a professor given the factors. 
## How we built it
We made the database itself through Python in cockroach DB, then used javascript and node.js to connect our database to the webpage through express.js. We also used HTML and CSS to style the web pages (introduction page and course analysis page). AI was used to interpret data from the database and gave an evaluation based on that data.
## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenges we faced were learning how to create and connect to a database, using things that we haven't used before, and working with AI frameworks.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Considering that this was our first time working with a lot of these programs, we are proud of getting out a usable product that can help our community. 
## What we learned
We were able to take a close look at the differences between front-end and back-end programming and how to connect the two. made a server using express.js
## What's next for Testudo's Choice
For the future of this project, we plan on taking more time to improve the website UI, compare courses, decrease loading speed, update the AI framework, and have an analysis of student schedules to determine how difficult the semester will be and the efficiency of the overall schedule.
